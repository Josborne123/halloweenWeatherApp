# halloweenWeatherApp

This is a weather app for J.P Morgan halloween themed project coding competition 2022

This application will take a location and a date and return the weather data in that place on that day.

Note: for the surprise me button, on some dotes on certain locations there is no data on the API so all values will return 0

Limitations: 1,000 API calls allowed per day
